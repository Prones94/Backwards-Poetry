# Backwards-Poetry
## Description

1. You can store your poem as a multi line string in Python, you do not need to read from a file.

2.Your code should implement the lines_printed_backwards() function. This function takes in a list of strings containing the lines of your poem as arguments and will print the poem lines out in reverse with the line numbers reversed.

3.Your code should implement the lines_printed_random() function which will randomly select lines from a list of strings and print them out in random order. Repeats are okay and the number of lines printed should be equal to the original number of lines in the poem (line numbers don't need to be printed)

4.Your code should implement a function of your choice that rearranges the poem in a unique way, be creative! Make sure that you carefully comment your custom function so it's clear what it does.
